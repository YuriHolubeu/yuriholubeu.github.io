## About Me



Currently, I'm a researcher at the Institute of Stephen Joseph in Ljubljana.
Most of my days I keep thinking about some research-related topics or mastering typical methods of physics or mathematics.
On this webpage, I have collected the notes that I made while passing courses at KU Leuven, MIPT, and while conducting research.
I work on some of them daily and update them here once a month. 
If you want to discuss some parts of physics, send me an e-mail or contact me on Telegram.
